# 🤝 Contributing to mcp-server-solidworks

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **mcp-server-solidworks**, an AI-powered contextual assistant that communicates with SolidWorks through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and local LLMs like Claude.  
Our goal is to make CAD smarter — and you're invited to help us build it.

We welcome all contributions, including code, documentation, bug reports, testing, feature suggestions, and UI design.
